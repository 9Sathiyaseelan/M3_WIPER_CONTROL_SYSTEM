#   **Introduction:**

A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor (30) detecting rain conditions to produce . An analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions. The analog sensor signal is converted into a digital pulse signal by a converter (12) for application to a digital circuit system. A control signal is produced by digitally processing the pulse signal. The control signal is applied to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal.


#  **Advantages:**
- It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains.
- Less Power Consumption.
- High Accuracy.

#  **Disadvantages:**
- This system applied in case of water falling on glass only.
- Addition cost is required to install system for For wheelers.

# **SWOT Analysis:**
**Strength**
- Can operate autonomously with fixed onboard stored speed limits
- Increase safety.

**Weakness**
- Can be frustrating at low penetration rates.
- Can lead to potential decrease of average speed and consequently,to an increase of travel times.

**Threats**
- MTM delayed adaptation.
- User acceptance in terms both purchase intention and frequent activation after purchase.
